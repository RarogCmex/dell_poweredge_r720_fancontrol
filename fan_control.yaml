# ============================================================================
# IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT CONFIGURATION:
# ============================================================================
# 1. CPU/GPU curves must have the same number of temperature grades for predictable behavior
# 2. Temperatures must be in strictly ascending order (e.g., [55, 60, 70, 75])
# 3. Speeds should generally be in ascending order (e.g., [13, 17, 25, 37])
# 4. Temperatures must be between 0-125°C, speeds between 1-100%
# 5. Each curve must have at least 2 temperature/speed pairs
# 6. When temperature exceeds the highest threshold, automatic mode takes over
# 7. The hotspot_threshold protects against individual CPU cores overheating
